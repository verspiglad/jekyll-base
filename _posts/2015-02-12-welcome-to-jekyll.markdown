If've you have arrived here, then welcome this blog is a personal exploration of things I find interesting.

Some of the topics I hope to cover include:
-Personal Data
-Quantified Self
-Personal analytics
-Social Media
-Start Ups

Note:

I intend to run this site for personal interest rather than monetary gain.  The content of this site is not curated on a commerical basis or at the request of advertisers etc. However, the links to external sites may contain referral links that allow offers, rewards, or other incentives. I will make it clear when content or offers are inlcuded at the request of a third party. In addition I will on a monthly basis provide an account of any rewards recieved.
